<div id="r1">Opera refers to a dramatic art form, originating in Europe, in which the emotional content is conveyed to the audience as much through music, both vocal and instrumental, as it is through the lyrics. By contrast, in musical theater an actor's dramatic performance is primary, and the music plays a lesser role. The drama in opera is presented using the primary elements of theater such as scenery, costumes, and acting. However, the words of the opera, or libretto, are sung rather than spoken. The singers are accompanied by a musical ensemble ranging from a small instrumental ensemble to a full symphonic orchestra.</div>
<div id="q1">It is stated in the reading that ----.</div>
<div id="1a">acting and costumes are secondary to music in musical theater</div>
<div id="1b">many people find musical theater more captivating than opera</div>
<div id="1c">music in musical theater is not as important as it is in opera</div>
<div id="1d">an opera requires a huge orchestra as well as a large choir</div>
<div id="r2">Dolphins are regarded as the friendliest creatures in the sea and stories of them helping drowning sailors have been common since Roman times. The more we learn about dolphins, the more we realize that their society is more complex than people previously imagined. They look after other dolphins when they are ill, care for pregnant mothers and protect the weakest in the community, as we do. Some scientists have suggested that dolphins have a language but it is much more probable that they communicate with each other without needing words. Could any of these mammals be more intelligent than man? Certainly the most common argument in favor of man's superiority over them that we can kill them more easily than they can kill us is the least satisfactory. On the contrary, the more we discover about these remarkable creatures, the less we appear superior when we destroy them.</div>
<div id="q2">The writer of the passage thinks that the fact that we can kill dolphins more easily than they can kill us ----.</div>
<div id="2a">means that they are better adapted to their environment than we are</div>
<div id="2b">shows that dolphins have a very sophisticated form of communication </div>
<div id="2c">proves that dolphins are not the most intelligent species at sea</div>
<div id="2d"> does not mean that we are superior to them</div>
<div id="r3">Naval architects never claim that a ship is unsinkable, but the sinking of the passenger-and-car ferry Estonia in the Baltic surely should have never have happened. It was well designed and carefully maintained. It carried the proper number of lifeboats. It had been thoroughly inspected the day of its fatal voyage. Yet hours later, the Estonia rolled over and sank in a cold, stormy night. It went down so quickly that most of those on board, caught in their dark, flooding cabins, had no chance to save themselves. Of those who managed to scramble overboard, only 139 survived. The rest died of hypothermia before the rescuers could pluck them from the cold sea. The final death toll amounted to 912 souls. However, there were an unpleasant number of questions about why the Estonia sank and why so many survivors were men in the prime of life, while most of the dead were women, children and the elderly.</div>
<div id="q3">One can understand from the reading that ----.</div>
<div id="3a">design faults and incompetent crew contributed to the sinking of the Estonia ferry</div>
<div id="3b">139 people managed to leave the vessel but died in freezing water</div>
<div id="3c">naval architects claimed that the Estonia was unsinkable</div>
<div id="3d">most victims were trapped inside the boat as they were in their cabins</div>
<div id="r4">Erosion of America's farmland by wind and water has been a problem since settlers first put the prairies and grasslands under the plow in the nineteenth century. By the 1930s, more than 282 million acres of farmland were damaged by erosion. After 40 years of conservation efforts, soil erosion has accelerated due to new demands placed on the land by heavy crop production. In the years ahead, soil erosion and the pollution problems it causes are likely to replace petroleum scarcity as the nation's most critical natural resource problem</div>
<div id="q4">As we understand from the reading, today, soil erosion in America ----.</div>
<div id="4a">causes humans to place new demands on the land</div>
<div id="4b">is worse than it was in the nineteenth century</div>
<div id="4c">happens so slowly that it is hardly noticed</div>
<div id="4d">is the most critical problem that the nation faces</div>
<div id="r5">Data from the Pioneer spacecraft of NASA apparently prove the theory that the high surface temperature of Venus is due to an atmospheric greenhouse effect caused mainly by a blanket of carbon dioxide. Such a greenhouse effect is created when energy in the form of sunlight easily passes through a planet's atmosphere, warms its surface, and is converted to heat radiation that is then held in by the atmosphere from top to bottom. Venus has a relatively thin atmosphere like the Earth's, but Venus' atmosphere consists of more than ninety percent carbon dioxide, compared to less than four percent in that of the Earth. Because of its higher percentage of carbon dioxide, Venus' atmosphere traps much more heat radiation than does the Earth's. Thus, the Venus studies are believed to be important to the understanding of possible adverse effects on the Earth's agriculture that could result from the long-term use of fossil fuels, which add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</div>
<div id="q5">According to the passage, data from the Venus study can be used to ----.</div>
<div id="5a"> measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere accurately </div>
<div id="5b"> increase the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere</div>
<div id="5c"> test the efficiency of the spacecraft sent to Venus by NASA</div>
<div id="5d"> predict future agricultural problems on Earth</div>
<div id="r6"> Theories about how brain works remain a topic of debate. It is agreed, though, that the hippocampus, a part of the brain, is undeniably important for memory. When we experience something, the information is sent via our senses to the hippocampus, where it is processed. Scientists believe that brain cells called neurons first transform the sensory stimuli we experience into images in our immediate memory. Then, these images are sent to the hippocampus and stored temporarily in short term memory. In the hippocampus information is organized, and it is during this process that parts of the image of our experience fade away. Finally, certain information is then transferred to long term memory in a section in the frontal lobe of the brain known as the cerebral cortex. Scientists think this process may happen while we are sleeping, but exactly how the information is transferred from one area of the brain to another is a mystery.</div>
<div id="q6">According to the passage scientists ----.</div>
<div id="6a"> know that information is sent from the long term memory to the hippocampus</div>
<div id="6b"> have found out why some of the information is lost in the hippocampus</div>
<div id="6c"> don't know exactly how the information is transferred from one area of the brain to another</div>
<div id="6d"> agree on how the brain works</div>
<div id="r7">Over the past thirty years or so the quality of many people's lives has deteriorated in some respects because of technological progress. Those people living near airports are constantly assailed by the noise of increasingly larger and more powerful jet aircraft taking off and landing. We have ugly buildings which have sprung up in towns and cities. Some of these are blocks of flats-high-rise buildings built because of the high price of land, which seem more like breeding boxes than houses where people have space to live. Worse still, much of our building effort has been channeled into the construction of more and more large office blocks at the expense of much needed housing for the growing urban population.</div>
<div id="q7">We have ugly buildings ----.</div>
<div id="7a"> so we need to improve technology</div>
<div id="7b"> because the land is expensive</div>
<div id="7c"> but we don't have much complaint about it</div>
<div id="7d"> where people find enough space to live</div>
<div id="r8">The Bermuda Triangle occupies a disturbing and almost unbelievable place in the world's catalog of unexplained mysteries. More than a hundred planes and ships have vanished in this area into the air since 1945, and more than a thousand lives have been lost, without a single body or even a piece wreckage from the vanishing planes or ships having been found. Many of the planes concerned have vanished while in normal radio contact with their base until the very moment of their disappearance, while others have radioed the most extraordinary messages, implying that they could not get their instruments to function, that their compasses were spinning, that the sky had turned yellow and hazy on a clear day, and the ocean, which was calm nearby, didn't look right without further clarification of what was wrong.</div>
<div id="q8">It is pointed out in the passage that ----.</div>
<div id="8a"> most of the missing planes could contact with their base by their own special means until the very moment of disappearing</div>
<div id="8b"> thousands of people lost their lives in the Bermuda Triangle in 1945 </div>
<div id="8c"> all of the disappearances happened during the day time</div>
<div id="8d"> the Bermuda Triangle mystery was solved in 1945</div>
<div id="r9">When the air is clear, the sunset will appear yellow, because the light from the sun has passed a long distance through air and the blue light has been scattered away. If the air is polluted with small particles, natural or otherwise, the sunset will be more red. Sunsets over the sea may also be orange, due to salt particles in the air. The sky around the sun is seen reddened, as well as the light coming directly from the sun. This is because all light is scattered relatively well through small angles, but blue light is then more likely to be scattered twice over the greater distances, leaving the yellow, red and orange colors.</div>
<div id="q9">As it is pointed out in the passage, ----.</div>
<div id="9a">our eyes are more sensitive to light with blue frequencies </div>
<div id="9b"> the red light passes easily through the air without scattering at all </div>
<div id="9c"> when the sun sets, only the blue light is left </div>
<div id="9d"> the sunset is likely to look orange when small particles, such as salt from sea spray, are in the air</div>
<div id="r10">An ultralight airplane is very different from a conventional airplane. It looks like a lawn chair with wings, weighs no more than 254 pounds, flies up to 60 miles an hour, and carries about 5 gallons of fuel. Most ultralights are sold as kits and take about 40 hours to assemble. Flying an ultralight is so easy that a pilot with no experience can fly one. Accidents are rarely fatal or even serious because the ultralight lands so slowly and gently and carries so little fuel. Some models now have parachutes attached, while others have parachute packs which pilots can wear. </div>
<div id="q10">It is pointed out in the reading that ----.</div>
<div id="10a"> there is more risk involved in flying ultralight aeroplanes than in flying general aviation aircraft</div>
<div id="10b"> ultralight airplanes can remain airborne for more than an hour </div>
<div id="10c"> the risk of injury to a passenger in an ultralight airplane is very low</div>
<div id="10d"> the gear an ultralight airplane carries can be more fragile than traditional equipment</div>
<div id="r11">Modern scientific and technological developments in the practice of medicine and public health have drawn nursing into new and wider fields of activity, and its functions have been expanded accordingly. Therefore, nursing is no longer limited mainly to activities within the hospital, or to what is called curative nursing. It has become also a community service in which preventive and rehabilitative functions are a vital part of its program. The modern concept of nursing considers the hospital, however central, as only one of many health agencies in the community.</div>
<div id="q11">According to the passage, the nurse's function has been expanded because of ----.</div>
<div id="11a"> hospitals, which are the most common work environments for nurses</div>
<div id="11b"> the reluctance of nurses to work in the hospital</div>
<div id="11c"> the necessity of working longer hours</div>
<div id="11d"> the progress in science and technology in related fields</div>
<div id="r12">Earthquake is a sudden movement in Earth's crust which produces vibration. These vibrations may be detectable only by sensitive instruments called seismographs, or else they may kill thousands as they destroy cities. Many earthquakes are caused when rocks move along faults. Severe earthquakes are most common near the edges of the "plates" in the Earth's crust, such as around the Pacific Ocean, along the mid-Atlantic ridge and in the Mediterranean and South- West Asian regions. They occur when the plates move. Some earthquakes are caused by volcanic action, explosions, and other factors. Earthquakes under the sea trigger off huge waves called tsunamis.</div>
<div id="q12">According to the passage, ----.</div>
<div id="12a"> seismographs may devastate cities if not detected</div>
<div id="12b"> earthquakes are caused by huge waves called tsunamis </div>
<div id="12c"> earthquakes are more likely to happen where there are faults</div>
<div id="12d"> sudden movements in the earth's crust are called volcanic eruptions</div>
<div id="r13">When early humans hunted and gathered food, they were not in control of their environment. They could only interact with their surroundings as lower organisms did. When humans learned to make fire, however, they became capable of altering their environment. To provide themselves with fuel they stripped bark from trees, causing the trees to die. Clearings were burned in forests to increase the growth of grass and to provide a greater grazing area for the wild animals that humans fed upon. This development led to farming and the domestication of animals. Fire also provided the means for cooking plants which had previously been inedible. Only when the process of meeting the basic need for food reached a certain level of sophistication was it possible for humans to follow other pursuits such as the founding of cities</div>
<div id="q13">As we understand from the passage, early humans ----.</div>
<div id="13a"> were the prey of many predators</div>
<div id="13b"> used fire as a tool to alter their surroundings</div>
<div id="13c"> gained better control of their environment when they learned to live with lower organisms</div>
<div id="13d"> started to maintain their food supply by hunting and gathering food when they started cooking with fire</div>
<div id="r14">The Great Hanshin earthquake, or the Kobe earthquake as it is more commonly known overseas, was an earthquake in Japan that measured 7.2 on the Japanese Scale. It occurred on January 17, 1995 at 5:46 am 52 seconds in the southern part of Hyogo Prefecture and lasted for approximately 20 seconds. The epicenter of the earthquake was on the northern end of Awaji Island, near the cosmopolitan city of Kobe with a population of 1.5 million. A total of 6,433 people, mainly in the city of Kobe, lost their lives. Additionally, it caused approximately ten trillion yen in damage. It is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the costliest natural disaster. It was the worst earthquake in Japan since the Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, which claimed 140,000 lives.</div>
<div id="q14"> It is stated in the passage that the number of deaths in the city of Kobe ----.</div>
<div id="14a"> was greater than that of Hurricane Katrina</div>
<div id="14b"> was not as high as in the Great Kanto earthquake</div>
<div id="14c"> exceeded that of any known earthquake</div>
<div id="14d"> was extremely high for an earthquake of this magnitude</div>
<div id="r15">First language, also known as mother tongue, is generally the language a person learns first. However, one can have two or more native languages thus being a native bilingual or indeed multilingual. The order in which these languages are learned is not necessarily the order of proficiency. Incomplete first language skills often make learning other languages difficult. Often a child learns the basics of his or her first language or languages from his or her family. The term mother tongue, however, should not be interpreted to mean that it is the language of one's mother. For instance, in some paternal societies, the wife moves in with the husband and thus may have a different first language or dialect than the local language of the husband. Yet their children usually only speak their local language.</div>
<div id="q15">One can infer from the reading that ----.</div>
<div id="15a"> one cannot be a native speaker of more than two languages </div>
<div id="15b"> very few children throughout the world learn to speak two languages </div>
<div id="15c"> it is possible for a bilingual to become more competent in his second language</div>
<div id="15d"> only a few people learn to speak his or her mother's language like a native</div>
<div id="r16">Aristotle, who lived from 384 BC to 322 BC, taught that the heart contained the intelligence. Except for a few guesses like this, he observed carefully. He described the habits and the bodily structure (anatomy) of many animals, birds and fish. Another Greek, Galen, who lived in the second century AD, performed biological experiments. Both careful observation of living things and experiments are used today in the study of biology. Galen observed and described the internal anatomy of the human body.-He described many parts that he saw in the body. But he was not always careful. He sometimes described what he expected to see and did not look carefully to see what was really there. For centuries after Galen, people studied anatomy from his books instead of trusting their own observations.</div>
<div id="q16">A Greek scientist, Galen ----.</div>
<div id="16a"> became more successful than Aristotle</div>
<div id="16b"> sometimes depended more on his ideas than observation</div>
<div id="16c"> lived in Greece during his whole life-time</div>
<div id="16d"> adapted the works of Aristotle</div>
<div id="r17">Stonehenge is an ancient monument situated about ten miles north of Salisbury in England. It was built about 4500 years ago, but by whom and for what purpose remains a mystery. The builders must have known of geometry. They may have been influenced by the Mycenaeans, whose architecture was similar. Some of the stones must have been brought from West Wales, over 135 miles away. These stones weigh more than fifty tons. They may have been brought on rafts and rollers. Experts say that it must have taken 1500 men more than five years to transport them. Stonehenge was probably built in three stages. First, settlers from continental Europe built a temple for sun worship. Later the "Beaker" people added the stone circles. Finally, people of the Wesse Culture transformed Stonehenge into an observatory. They could calculate the exact time of Midsummer and Midwinter and of equinoxes. </div>
<div id="q17">According to the passage, there is no certainty about ----.</div>
<div id="17a"> where the Stonehenge was built</div>
<div id="17b"> what kind of stones were used in the construction of the Stonehenge </div>
<div id="17c"> how to calculate the exact time of Midsummer and Midwinter and of equinoxes</div>
<div id="17d"> how the stones used in the construction of the Stonehenge were transported</div>
<div id="r18">Often mistaken for insects, spiders actually belong to a different classification of creatures, called arachnids. They're insects' worst enemies. Although a few species, such as the black widow and the brown recluse, are dangerous, the majority are harmless to humans. Moreover, they can be helpful. Pest control, for example is just one of the many ways spiders can help us. Because they kill far more pests than commercial insecticides do. In the future, perhaps if farmers employ armies of spiders to protect their fields, our grocery bills will be lower and our soil and water and food will have fewer pesticide remains. </div>
<div id="q18"> The black widow and the brown recluse ----.</div>
<div id="18a"> are often confused with other species of spiders</div>
<div id="18b"> are two of the few dangerous species of spiders</div>
<div id="18c"> do the greatest harm to soil, water, and food</div>
<div id="18d"> don't belong to the classification of creatures called "arachnids."</div>
<div id="r19">In the 1920s, new technology allowed filmmakers to attach to each film a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen. These sound films were initially distinguished by calling them talking pictures, or talkies. The next major step in the development of cinema was the introduction of color. While the addition of sound to film revolutionized the medium, quickly driving out silent movies, color was adopted more gradually. The public was relatively indifferent to color photography as opposed to black-and-white. But as color processes improved and became as affordable as black-and-white film, more and more movies were filmed in color after the end of World War II, as the industry in America came to view color an essential to attracting audiences in its competition with television, which remained a black-and-white medium until the mid-60s. By the end of the 1960s, color had become the norm for filmmakers. </div>
<div id="q19">We can understand from the passage that the introduction of sound films ----.</div>
<div id="19a"> occurred at the time of the introduction of color films</div>
<div id="19b"> was not easy because it was not affordable</div>
<div id="19c"> made color movies a possibility on a commercial basis </div>
<div id="19d"> was an important milestone in the film industry</div>
<div id="r20">People seldom feel neutral about poetry. Those who love it sometimes give the impression that it is an adequate substitute for food, shelter, and love. But it isn't. Those who dislike poetry on principle sometimes claim, on the other hand, that poetry is only words and good for nothing. That's not true either. When words represent and recreate genuine human feelings, as they often do in poetry, they can be very important. Poems provide, in fact, a language for feeling, and one of poetry's most insistent merits involves its attempt to express the inexpressible. One of the joys of experiencing poetry occurs when we read a poem and want to say, "yes, that is just what it is like; I know exactly what that line means but I have never been able to express it so well." Poetry can be the voice of our feelings even when our minds are speechless with grief or joy.</div>
<div id="q20">The author points out in the reading that ----.</div>
<div id="20a"> poems are primarily about how people think rather than how people feel </div>
<div id="20b"> poetry can't be the expression of one's deepest feelings</div>
<div id="20c"> poetry is not closely concerned with feelings</div>
<div id="20d"> poetry tries to express what people feel but find it hard to describe</div>
<div id="r21">People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. Two distinct schools of thought on the matter have developed. The two approaches are very different from one another. The controversy is often referred to as nature and nurture. Those who support the nature side of the conflict believe that our personalities and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological and genetic factors. That our environment has little to do with our abilities, characteristics, and behavior is central to this theory. Proponents of the nurture theory claim that our environment is more important than our biologically based instinct in determining how we will act. They see humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. Neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior. In fact, it is quite likely that the key to our behavior lies somewhere between these two extremes. That the controversy will continue for a long time is certain.</div>
<div id="q21">One point made by the writer in the passage is that ----.</div>
<div id="21a">  heredity is more important than the environment in the development of human beings </div>
<div id="21b"> the correct explanation of human behavior will probably take ideas from both theories </div>
<div id="21c"> environment is the most important factor in determining personality </div>
<div id="21d">  the behaviorists' view correctly explains how we act</div>
<div id="r22">Scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches all spell misery, but being able to tell if the cause is a cold or flu may make a difference in how long the flu lasts. That's because the prescription drugs available for the flu need to be taken soon after the illness sets in although the symptoms can be eased with over the counter medications. As for colds, the sooner a person starts taking over-the-counter remedy, the sooner relief will come. Cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose and scratchy throat typically develop gradually, and adults and teens often do not get a fever. On the other hand, fever is one of the characteristic features of the flu for all ages. And in general, flu symptoms including fever and chills, sore throat and body aches come on suddenly and are more severe than cold symptoms. </div>
<div id="q22"> According to the passage, knowing the cause of scratchy throats, stuffy noses and body aches ----.</div>
<div id="22a"> will shorten the duration of the flu </div>
<div id="22b"> reduces the likelihood of catching cold. </div>
<div id="22c"> sometimes doesn't help patients lessen the severity of symptoms </div>
<div id="22d"> encourages patients to buy over-the-counter medications</div>
<div id="r23">In bringing up children, every parent, regardless of ethnicity, income, education, or geographic location, watches eagerly the child's acquisition of each new skill. However, it is often tempting to hurry the child beyond his natural learning rate, which can set up dangerous feelings of failure and states of worry in the child. This might happen at any stage. A baby might be forced to use a toilet too early, a young child might be encouraged to learn to read before he knows the meaning of the words he reads. On the other hand, though, if a child is left alone too much, or without any learning opportunities, he loses his natural enthusiasm for life and his desire to find out new things for himself. Parents vary greatly in their degree of strictness towards their children. Some may be especially strict in money matters. Others are severe over times of coming home at night or punctuality for meals. In general, the controls imposed represent the needs of the parents and the values of the community as much as the child's own benefit. </div>
<div id="q23"> According to the passage, in the process of children's learning new skills, parents ----.</div>
<div id="23a"> must encourage them to read before they know the meaning of the words they read</div>
<div id="23b"> should achieve a balance between pushing them too hard and leaving them on their own</div>
<div id="23c"> never expect too much of their children</div>
<div id="23d"> should create as many learning opportunities as possible for themselves</div>
<div id="r24">Psychologist George Spilich at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, decided to find out whether, as many smokers say, smoking helps them to think and concentrate. He put non-smokers, active smokers and smokers deprived of cigarettes through a series of tests. In the first test, each subject sat before a computer screen and pressed a key as soon as he or she recognized a target letter. In this simple test, smokers, deprived smokers and non-smokers performed equally well. The next test was more complex. Non-smokers were faster, but under the stimulation of nicotine, active smokers were faster than deprived smokers. In the third test of short-term memory, non-smokers made the fewest errors, but deprived smokers committed fewer errors than active smokers. In the fourth test, non-smokers were the best and deprived smokers bested those who had smoked a cigarette just before testing. As the tests became more complex, non-smokers performed better than smokers by wider and wider margins. </div>
<div id="q24">It is pointed out in the passage that the purpose of George Spilich's experiments is ----.</div>
<div id="24a"> to test whether smoking has a positive effect on the mental capacity of smokers</div>
<div id="24b">to show how smoking damages people's mental capacity</div>
<div id="24c"> to prove that smoking affects people's regular performance</div>
<div id="24d">to show that non-smokers are less productive at work than smokers</div>
<div id="r25">Although there is a great deal of variation within each gender, on the average men and women discuss a surprisingly different range of topics. According to some studies, women and men ranging in age from seventeen to eighty described the range of topics each discussed with friends of the same sex. Certain topics were common to both men and women: work, movies, and television proved to be frequent topics for both groups. The differences between men and women were more striking than the similarities. Female friends spent much more time discussing personal and domestic subjects, relationship problems, family, health and reproductive matters, weight, food and clothing. Men, on the other hand, were more likely to discuss music, current events, sports and business. Women were more likely to gossip about close friends and family. By contrast, men spent more time gossiping about sports figures and media personalities. These differences can lead to frustration when men and women try to converse with one another.
</div>
<div id="q25">It is stated in the passage that women ----.</div>
<div id="25a"> are unwilling to discuss personal subjects</div>
<div id="25b"> are more interested in discussing relationship problems than are men</div>
<div id="25c"> never talk about other men and women</div>
<div id="25d"> don't like gossiping about anything</div>
<div id="r26">One of the major processes that takes place in schools, of course, is that students learn. When they graduate from high school, many can use a computer, write essays with three-part theses, and differentiate equations. In addition to learning specific skills, they learn to think critically, to weigh evidence and to develop independent judgment. The extent to which this development takes place is related to both school and home environments. Teachers who are more open to new ideas and less authoritarian produce students who have greater intellectual flexibility and higher achievement test scores. Studies show that teachers are most demanding when they are of the same social class as their students. The greater the difference between their own social class and that of their pupils, the more rigidly they structure their classrooms and the fewer demands they place on their students.</div>
<div id="q26">It is stated in the passage that teachers who are more open to new ideas ----.</div>
<div id="26a"> produce more successful students in terms of test scores and intellectual flexibility</div>
<div id="26b"> often come from a lower social class than their students</div>
<div id="26c"> are more authoritarian towards students</div>
<div id="26d"> discourage intellectual flexibility in schools</div>
<div id="r27">Parents teach their children to be fearful and cautious of specific dangers, such as fire or crossing the road. Anxiety can be useful, because it helps protect the child from harm. However, children can be fearful of situations or objects that adults don't consider threatening. The sources of fear may change as the child matures; for example, a fear of the dark or monsters under the bed may give way to fears of burglary or violence. Tactics that don't work include teasing the child for being afraid, or compelling them to confront fearful situations. Helping the child to deal with fear includes taking their feelings seriously, encouraging them to talk about their anxieties, telling them the facts, and giving them the opportunity to confront their fears at their own pace and with your support. </div>
<div id="q27"> It is stated in the article that ----.</div>
<div id="27a">  making fun of the child's fears is the best way to get rid of them </div>
<div id="27b"> the best way to avoid fears during childhood is to ignore them </div>
<div id="27c"> every single child has a fear of burglary and violence </div>
<div id="27d"> the fears of the childhood can lead to some other fears in the adulthood</div>
<div id="r28">Panda is the name for two nocturnal Asian mammals: the red panda and the giant panda. The red panda, also known as lesser panda and cat bear, is found at high elevations in the Himalayas. It resembles a raccoon but has a longer body and tail and a more rounded head. Its thick fur is rust color to deep chestnut, with black on the under parts, limbs, and ears. The red panda spends much of its time in trees but feeds on the ground, eating primarily bamboo leaves but also fruit and roots. The giant panda superficially resembles a bear. The body is chiefly white, and the limbs are brownish black, with the dark color extending up over the shoulder. The ears and eye patches are black. Giant pandas live in restricted areas of the high mountain bamboo forests of central China; their diet consists entirely of bamboo shoots. Rare in the wild, they produce young poorly when they are not in their natural environment. Giant pandas are protected by law in China.</div>
<div id="q28"> It can be inferred from the passage that ----.</div>
<div id="28a"> though they share a name, red and giant pandas are not alike in many ways </div>
<div id="28b"> the number of the bamboo forests of China is decreasing</div>
<div id="28c"> red pandas usually live on chestnuts just like giant pandas</div>
<div id="28d"> all the mammals at high elevations in the Himalayas are nocturnal</div>
<div id="r29">Homer was a Greek epic poet. Both the date and the place of his birth and death are not known precisely, but recent research suggests a date between 1050 and 800 BC. It has even been claimed that no such man as Homer existed and that The Iliad and The Odyssey are collections of traditional ballads and not the work of one man. In any event they were known all over the Greek-speaking world before the sixth century BC. The Iliad is an epic poem dealing with the siege of Troy by the Greeks. The Odyssey describes the wandering of Odysseus, a Greek seafarer, on his way back to Ithaca after the fall of Troy.</div>
<div id="q29">It is clear that ----.
 </div>
<div id="29a"> it's not definite when and where Homer was born </div>
<div id="29b"> recent research shows the impossibility of finding Homer's birth date</div>
<div id="29c"> some suggest that he was born in 800 BC</div>
<div id="29d"> Homer's birth place is known but his date of birth is still unknown</div>
<div id="r30">Tea had a reputation for being both safe and almost always beneficial. However, scientists are now suggesting that tea may not be as safe as we had previously believed. Tea contains caffeine, and caffeine has been linked to sleeplessness and to the unpleasant jumpy feeling some people get when stressed. More seriously, there is a link between miscarriages, and pregnant women are advised to reduce their intake of tea until after their baby is born. Due to its critical side-effects, some people who like tea choose to be safer and drink a beverage from which the caffeine has been removed, decaffeinated tea, but many claim that it simply doesn't taste right. The reasonable thing to do is probably moderation; continue to enjoy a cup of tea, but don't have too many!</div>
<div id="q30">The writer points out that the best solution is to drink ----.</div>
<div id="30a"> decaffeinated tea</div>
<div id="30b"> instant coffee </div>
<div id="30c"> tea in moderation</div>
<div id="30d"> other beverages like hot chocolate</div>
<div id="r31">
It often appears that we have more to gain by speaking than by listening. One big advantage of speaking is that it gives you a chance to control others' thoughts and actions. Whatever your goal is, the key to success seems to be the ability to speak well. Another apparent advantage of speaking is the chance it provides to gain the admiration, respect, or liking of others. Finally, talking gives you the chance to release energy in a way that listening can't. In the same way, you can often lessen your anger by letting it out verbally.</div>
<div id="q31"> According to the passage, speaking can result in ----.</div>
<div id="31a"> decreasing anger </div>
<div id="31b"> increasing stress </div>
<div id="31c"> losing admiration of others </div>
<div id="31d"> decreasing excitement</div>
<div id="r32">A book has just been published to help parents to deal with their children's naughty behavior at home. The author, Dr James Bruno, says that the first positive discipline technique is for parents to remain calm because nervous parents don't get good results. Parents who cannot often remain calm find that their children stop taking any notice of them. The second challenge is to know how to correct bad behavior in an effective way. For instance, punishing children by preventing them from watching their favorite TV program is not an ideal solution. Dr Bruno believes parents should establish clear rules for children to follow. If children refuse to follow these, they know they will be disciplined. Finally, the most effective way of encouraging good behavior is to give positive feedback as often as possible, to show that it is not only naughtiness that attracts attention.</div>
<div id="q32">According to the article, when parents get angry too often, ----.</div>
<div id="32a">they yell at their children to make them obey an order </div>
<div id="32b"> they tell them off in front of their friends </div>
<div id="32c"> children often act as if they didn't hear them </div>
<div id="32d"> children get scared and obey their parents</div>
<div id="r33">The sad situation of the homeless remains a problem. It is difficult to estimate how many people are homeless because the number depends on how the homeless are defined. There are street people - those who sleep in bus stations, parks, and other areas. Many of these people are youthful runaways. There are the so-called sheltered homeless - those who sleep in government supported or privately funded shelters. Many of these individuals used to live with their families or friends. While street people are almost always single, the sheltered homeless include numerous families with children. Conservatives argue that many homeless are alcoholics, drug users, or mentally ill. In contrast, many liberals argue that homelessness is caused by a reduction in welfare benefits and by excessively priced housing. They want more shelters to be built for the homeless.</div>
<div id="q33">We can understand from the reading that the number of homeless people ----.</div>
<div id="33a"> is not so great as many people think </div>
<div id="33b"> is on the increase in many countries </div>
<div id="33c"> is counted annually. </div>
<div id="33d"> is difficult to know</div>
<div id="r34">The sheer number of people in a group affects the amount of communication. Consider the difference between communication between two friends and communication in a group of live people. When friends talk, there are two people sending and receiving messages. In a group of live, there are live people doing the same thing. Each idea that is expressed must be understood by four others, who may also choose to respond. Consequently, the greater number of people in a group, the fewer contributions any individual may make. Because there are disadvantages to large groups, you might assume that small groups would be the most effective.However, groups can be too small as well as too large. With too few members, a group has limited resources, which eliminates a primary advantage of groups for decision making. Also, in very small groups, members may be unwilling lo disagree or criticize each other's ideas. I believe that five to seven members is the ideal size for a small group.</div>
<div id="q34">The author of the article believes that ----.</div>
<div id="34a"> the number of people in a small group must not be more than five</div>
<div id="34b"> large groups are always superior to small groups </div>
<div id="34c"> the ideal size for a small group should be five to seven </div>
<div id="34d"> small groups are always better because members have a chance to criticize each other</div>
<div id="r35">A recent opinion poll discovered that many people were very concerned about the amount of sex and violence depicted in movies, television shows, and popular music. This poll also discovered, however, that most people thought that individuals should take responsibility to correct the problems. The vast majority favored such solutions as tighter parental supervision, warning labels on records, and voluntary self-restraints by entertainment companies. Only 27 percent favored government censorship. At the same time, there was growing concern about the impact of television on children. Research has shown that by the time our children reach age 18, they have spent more time watching television than in school. The problem was that our television system was attuned to the marketplace. Children are treated as a market to be sold to advertisers at so much money per thousand eyeballs.</div>
<div id="q35">According to the reading, to prevent the bad effects of television, only a minority ----.</div>
<div id="35a"> support individual action</div>
<div id="35b"> say parents should supervise their children</div>
<div id="35c"> believe in the necessity of censorship applied by governments</div>
<div id="35d"> think television companies have to control their own broadcasting</div>
<div id="r36">Motherly love by its very nature is unconditional. Mother loves the newborn infant because it is her child, not because the child has fulfilled any specific condition, or lived up to any specific expectations. Unconditional love corresponds to one of the deepest longings, not only of the child, but also of every human being. On the other hand, to be loved because of one's merit or because one deserves it, always leaves doubt and there is always a fear that love could disappear. Furthermore deserved love easily leaves a bitter feeling that one is not loved for himself but is loved only because he pleases, and that he is not loved at all but used. No wonder that we cling to the longing for motherly love, as children and also as adults. </div>
<div id="q36">  Accoridng to the reading, in order for a mother to love her child, ----.</div>
<div id="36a">  a child has to earn such love</div>
<div id="36b">they have to share many memories</div>
<div id="36c"> the child is expected to do what is required from him</div>
<div id="36d"> the child doesn't need to do anything</div>
<div id="r37">Magellan is a Portuguese navigator who shared the idea of Christopher Columbus and others that the Far East could be reached by sailing westward. He embarked from Spain in August 1519 with a fleet of five ships, sailed southward down the coast of South America and reached the Pacific Ocean through the Strait named after him. He then gave the Pacific its name, because his first impression of it was one of peace and calm. Magellan was killed by warring tribesmen in the Philippines, but one of his ships finally arrived back in Spain in September 1522 via the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the first to have circumnavigated the world.</div>
<div id="q37">According to the passage, ----.</div>
<div id="37a"> Magellan departed from Spain; however, he was not able to return</div>
<div id="37b"> Magellan named the Philippines and the strait</div>
<div id="37c"> Columbus and Magellan discovered the South America and named it</div>
<div id="37d"> the strait Magellan passed through gave him the impression that it was so calm and peaceful</div>
<div id="r38">The most dangerous animals on the North American continent, by a margin of 1000 to one, are not bears, mountain lions or wolves but poisonous snakes. Attacks occur far more frequently than most people suspect; 6500 to 7000 humans are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year. Fortunately, the death rate from snakebite is low, largely because of widespread knowledge about snakes and the fact that in most cases treatment is prompt. Yet for the victims, even though they survive, the ordeal is a dreadful experience sometimes resulting weeks or months of illness, permanent crippling, the loss of a hand or foot, or other lasting handicaps. </div>
<div id="q38">The death rate from snakebite ----.</div>
<div id="38a"> is quite high despite the well-informed people </div>
<div id="38b"> cannot be estimated by citizens in America</div>
<div id="38c"> deterred people not to go out during the day</div>
<div id="38d"> is considered to be small compared to the number of bites</div>
<div id="r39">Alcohol consumption may be linked to a women's risk of infertility, say researches supported by the National Institute of Child Health. In a study of nearly 6000 women, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health looked at Data from those evaluated at seven infertility clinics. After adjusting for other factors that could affect results, such as age and cigarette smoking, researchers found a strong association between alcohol (more than the equivalent of seven cans of beer a week) and infertility due to ovulation problems. The inability to conceive was about 30 percent more likely to occur in women who drank moderately and about 60 percent more likely in women who drank heavily.</div>
<div id="q39">The researchers supported by the National Institute of Child Health ----.</div>
<div id="39a"> took care of women who're suffering from alcohol </div>
<div id="39b"> have spent a lot of money on fertility</div>
<div id="39c"> have been victims of infertility</div>
<div id="39d"> said alcohol may affect women's fertility</div>
<div id="r40">Life processes are similar in all animals with backbones. So physiologists can find out a lot about the human body by studying animals such as frogs, rats and rabbits. Sometimes research involves the death of these animals. But physiologists take great care not to hurt the animals. The animals are usually put to sleep during the experiments so they do not feel pain. Many people think animals should not be used for experiments. But it is only by physiological research that medicine has been able to advance. Polio is a disease that attacks the nerves. Millions of people have been protected from polio by a fluid called a vaccine. Tissue from monkeys is used to make the vaccine. </div>
<div id="q40">Experimental researches ----.</div>
<div id="40a">are of paramount significance for curing monkeys infected with polio</div>
<div id="40b"> an important way that medicine can progress</div>
<div id="40c"> are carried out to remove infected tissues from the animals</div>
<div id="40d"> include using only reptiles to discover the vaccines</div>
